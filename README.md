**Teaching Assistants** (TAs): Aravind @Maxaravind & Vinay @VinayKyatham

## Course Objectives
Master the fundamentals of Deep Learning and implement the ideas learnt in [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org).

* We will closely follow the [Deep Learning Book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/)

* Relevant concepts would be implemented using [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org)

* Relevant low-level and important details such as data handling and manipulation using [tf.data](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/datasets) would be taught

* **Individual Project**: Implement two *selected* publications pertaining to NLP and Computer Vision. Further details TBD later in the course
